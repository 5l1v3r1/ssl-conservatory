The SSL Conservatory
====================

Correct implementation of SSL is crucial to secure transmission of data 
between clients and servers. However, this crucial task is frequently done 
improperly, due to complex APIs and lack of understanding of SSL fundamentals.

This is intended to be a clearinghouse for well-documented and secure sample 
code to correctly implement SSL clients, starting with the most complex and 
frequently misused example: OpenSSL in C. Pull requests with examples for 
other languages or frameworks are encouraged.
